## Detailed Explanation :

Phone number(s) are the calling number(s) that your assistant(s) would need to have an access to, that they can use to call you customers on your behalf. So, we use third party dailers that can provide such a number. So, when you successfully setup a campaign, your customers would receive a call from this number. You can add one or multiple numbers to your account, and you can use a single phone number in all of your campaigns or use a different phone number for each campaign.
