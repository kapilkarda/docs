description: "You need to fill in all the information, which is the contact number (enter manually in a single call, but if you want a batch call, you need to upload a CSV file), and the remaining information remains the same. Then, enter the goal, call opening message, script (you can use a template or create your script with the help of AI Assistant), voice note, choice of accent, maximum duration of call, knowledge base, transfer number (your Twilio number), and message (action). If you have already created an assistant, you can choose the assistant, and the information will be automatically filled with the help of the assistant details that you created before."
