## In Assistants functionality :

### Call Transfer:

Below the recording option, you will find the "Call Transfer" option. Here, you can enter the transfer number so that when someone wants to call you back, they can do so.
Add a description for the transfer number.

### SMS Option:

In the SMS option, the agent will send the user an SMS with the desired content when a specific condition is met.

To set up the SMS option:

Write the SMS Content - This is the text that will be sent to the user via SMS.
Specify the Condition - Define the condition under which the SMS should be triggered, such as when a call is missed, a voicemail is left, or a specific keyword is detected in the conversation.

You will see the next <span style={{ fontWeight: 800 }}>Info Extractor</span>. Here you can add the question in three ways:

1. Yes/No Question: Add a question that can be answered with a simple "Yes" or "No".
2. Single Choice: Provide multiple options for the user, but they can only select one.
3. Open Question: Add an open-ended question allowing the user to provide a free answer.

Here I want to add a Yes/No question.

Now enter the identifier name, email, or anything that you want. I have a name, Allison, as the identifier. Add the question "Have you heard about PrecallAI before?". The question is now saved, and you can edit or delete it if needed. Add questions and options in the Single Choice and Open Question options, as per your preference then click Create.

Here is the information in the correct format:

### The next update is Zapier Hook.

PreCallAI lets you set up actions like booking appointments and sending links through Zapier. Too many actions can confuse the AI, so keep the number of actions small for the best results.

To set up a Zapier integration:

1. Go to Zapier.com and sign in to your account.
2. On the dashboard, click on the "Create" button to create a new Zap (automated workflow).
3. For the trigger, select "Webhooks by Zapier" and choose the "Catch Hook" event, then click "Continue".
4. In the "Test" step, you will find your Webhook URL. Copy this URL and paste it into the "Zapier Hook" field under the "Assistant" option in PreCallAI.

By following these steps, you can integrate PreCallAI with Zapier and set up automated actions through the Zapier platform.
