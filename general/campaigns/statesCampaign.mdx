These are the following campaign states you'd be seeing while using PreCall AI

<ul>
<li><code style={{ color: "#22c55e", border: "1px solid #22c55e" }}>Start</code></li> <br />

<li>
  <code style={{ color: "#ca8a04", border: "1px solid #ca8a04" }}>Paused</code>
</li> <br />

<li>
  <code style={{ color: "#3b82f6", border: "1px solid #3b82f6" }}>Running</code>
</li>
<br />

<li><code style={{ color: "#ef4444", border: "1px solid #ef4444" }}>Completed</code></li>
</ul>
When you create a new campaign, it's in its <code style={{ color: "#22c55e", border: "1px solid #22c55e" }}>Start</code> state i.e. this campaign is yet to be started. When you start the campaign, its state will change to <code style={{ color: "#3b82f6", border: "1px solid #3b82f6" }}>Running</code> and
the [Assistant](https://app.precallai.com/admin/assistants) start calling your customers
(added through your [ContactList](https://app.precallai.com/admin/contact-list))

If at any point you'd like to pause the campaign, you can simply click on the <code style={{ color: "#ca8a04", border: "1px solid #ca8a04" }}>PAUSE</code> button. Additionally, if we have no more users to call, we mark the campaign status as <code style={{ color: "#ef4444", border: "1px solid #ef4444" }}>Completed</code>

<Warning>
  One more thing you'd eventually come across is the quota limit exceeding. This
  will happen when the campaign is set to{" "}
  <code style={{ color: "#ca8a04", border: "1px solid #ca8a04" }}>PAUSE</code>{" "}
  state by us because your available minutes for calling have been fully
  utilized. You'd not be able to place any more calls unless you upgrade your
  plan or the quota renews automatically at end of the billing period.{" "}
</Warning>
